# VisionProcessingGPU-Kit
A GPU-accelerated image-processing microservice built with FastAPI, PyCUDA, and fully containerized with Docker for seamless deployment in any environment. This project provides a collection of four high-performance GPU filters: Gaussian Blur, Negative, Canny Edge Detection, and Emboss, executed directly on the GPU to deliver significantly improved performance over CPU-based approaches.
